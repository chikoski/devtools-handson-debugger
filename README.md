# Firefox's built-in debugger handson

How can we find out the reason of bugs in our softwares?
We have several options to do that,  
and using debuggers is one of the most efficient way.

A debugger is a tool to inspect softwares' behavior, 
which allows us follwing things without putting any modification to the target softwares'   

- Pausing programms' execution
- Observation on variables and their assigned values
- Line by line programs' execution

These features give us huge support during our debugging effort,
but many of us avoid it. We can assume several reasons, such as:

- console.log is powerful enough to cover almost all cases. 
- Hardness to find systematic resources to learn how to use debuggers. 

This handson event is aimed to offer us the first step to use debuggers.
After the event, we can powerful alternatives to console.log.
